# OpenGL Tutorial
The code I wrote while following the [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/) tutorial. 
The original tutorial is written in C++ but this tutorial is completely in C11. The goal of this repo is to provide an easy way for me learn and recall opengl, by providing concise explanations of what and why things are the way they are.
